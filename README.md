# Obstacle-course
In this project, me and my team made a game with the Lightweight Java Game Library (LWJGL) to accomplish coordination of distributed systems. This is done by making a real-time multiplayer game, where the server can be hosted on a VPN for 
players to play together across different networks. This is accomplished with the use of tuple-spaces. 
  
At the start of the game, one player is decided to be the enemy,
who will be controlling traps spread around the course. Should a player
get caught in one of these traps, they lose a life. If the enemy manages to
kill the course runners to the point that they have no more lives left, the
enemy has won the game.
